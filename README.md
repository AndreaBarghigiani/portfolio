# Andrea Barghigiani (aka cupofcraft) portfolio

Hi there 👋

I'm Andrea Barghigiani, and this is my portfolio (finally!) that you can find at [cupofcraft.dev](https://cupofcraft.dev).

Inside this portfolio, you can find:

- My resume
- My writing
- My projects
- My contact information

I've build this because I wanted to have my own space on the Internet, after years writing italian content on [SkillsAndMore](https://skillsandmore.org) I thought it was a good idea to bring my writings in english to spread my experience and knowledge with the world.

Consider this as a live project, I'm always working on it and improving it, so if you find any issue or have any suggestion, please open an issue here on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/portfolio).
