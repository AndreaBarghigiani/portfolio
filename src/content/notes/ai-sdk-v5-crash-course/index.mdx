### Why did I bought?

Matt is a great teacher and a well experienced develoeper that uses TypeScript even to make coffee 😅 Now he started a new adventure over at `aihero.dev` and while following Kent C. Dodds course on MCP I wanted to close the loop between server, agents and clients. And this is the first course that'll allow me to do so!

### What's in for you?

To be brutally honest, I do not know it yet. This is just my place where I am collecting notes on the courses I am learning, but I'm pretty sure sooner or later you'll find plenty of articles that will be more structured than these notes 😅
