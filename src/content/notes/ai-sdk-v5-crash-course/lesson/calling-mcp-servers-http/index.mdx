description: Here we should've learned how to connect to a remote MCP Server, but there are some issues 😞

import EL from '@/components/ui/ExternalLink.astro';

In this lesson we use the SSE transport `type` to connect to the remote GitHub MCP Server, unfortunately with no luck.

```ts
const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: {
    type: 'sse',
    url: 'https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
    },
  },
});
```
I'll get back to this later as this part really interests me.
