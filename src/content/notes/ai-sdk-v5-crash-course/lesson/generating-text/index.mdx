Generating text with AI SDK is a really simple task. Once you have selected the model you want to use and the prompt you want to send, all it's left it's calling the right function!
```ts
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai'; // <- This is what you're looking for!

const model = google('gemini-2.5-flash-lite');
const prompt = 'What is the capital of France?';

const result = await generateText({model, prompt});

console.log(result.text) // <- This is the answer
```
As you can see, AI SDK makes interacting with LLM a task that's incredibly easy. But don't get fooled <EL href="https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text">`generateText`</EL> has plenty of parameters that let's you customize in great details how we want it to behave.
