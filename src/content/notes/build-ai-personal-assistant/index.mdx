### Why did I bought?

Matt is a great teacher and a well experienced developer that uses TypeScript even to make coffee 😅 Now he started a new adventure over at `aihero.dev` and while following Kent C. Dodds course on MCP I wanted to learn more about Agents and how to implement them in my development.

### What's in for you?

To be brutally honest, I do not know it yet. This is just my place where I am collecting notes on the courses I am learning, but I'm pretty sure sooner or later you'll find plenty of articles that will be more structured than these notes 😅
