## Why Testing Matters

Testing gives confidence that application features behave as expected and helps prevent regressions when you refactor or ship new functionality. Within the Epic Testing Bundle, the **Testing Fundamentals** workshop lays the groundwork for thinking in terms of feedback loops and risk reduction.

## Key Ideas Captured

1. Define the desired user outcome first, then choose the right level of test.
2. Optimize for fast feedback: start with async-safe unit tests before reaching for heavier tools.
3. Embrace tooling conventions (like `vitest` and `testing-library`) to minimize boilerplate.

## Next Steps

- Reproduce the workshop examples locally.
- Document any friction points setting up the toolchain.
- Identify one production workflow that could benefit from these practices.
