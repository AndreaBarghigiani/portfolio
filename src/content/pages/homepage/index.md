Hi, I'm Andrea Barghigiani, a frontend engineer passionate about building great user experiences. I live in Italy with my partner and our two wonderful children, and I cherish spending quality time with them.

With over a decade of experience, I focus on creating intuitive, accessible interfaces that truly help end users while collaborating closely with designers and understanding the product's data and domain.

I'm always curious about new technologies but believe in applying them thoughtfully to solve real problems effectively. In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects that make family life easier and exploring ways to improve everyday digital experiences.

Let's connect and push the boundaries of what's possible 🚀
